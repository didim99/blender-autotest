Place unpacked portable blender instances (can be downloaded
from [here](https://download.blender.org/release/), for Windows/mac use `.zip` files)
in this folder using following file structure:

```
 /bin
 +- /blender
    +- /<platform>
       +- /<version1>
       |  +- files form blender archive
       +- /<version2>
          +- files form blender archive
```
